## Inspiration

The inspiration behind DubMeets was to create a platform that would help students collaborate and study together more effectively. We wanted to give students the ability to create their own study sessions and choose in-person locations to meet up with other students who share their academic goals.

## What it does

DubMeets is a platform that allows students to create and join study sessions based on their classes. Students can collaborate with other students who share their academic interests and choose in-person locations to meet up for their study sessions.

## How we built it

We built DubMeets using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We used a combination of front-end and back-end development techniques to create a responsive and scalable platform.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced a few challenges during the development of DubMeets, such as integrating the scheduling and location features, ensuring data privacy and security, and optimizing the platform for performance. However, we were able to overcome these challenges by working collaboratively and implementing innovative solutions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of creating a platform that empowers students to take control of their learning experience. We're also proud of our user-friendly interface, customizable study plans, and intuitive scheduling tools that make it easy for students to collaborate and optimize their study time.

##What we learned

Through the development of DubMeets, we learned the importance of collaboration, user feedback, and iteration. We also gained valuable experience in web development, database management, and user experience design.

## What's next for DubMeets

Our next steps for DubMeets include expanding the platform to more campuses and universities, integrating more features based on user feedback, and partnering with academic institutions to provide additional support and resources for students. We're excited to continue improving and growing DubMeets to help students achieve academic success.
