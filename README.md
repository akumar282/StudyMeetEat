## Inspiration

The inspiration behind DubMeets was to create a platform that would help students collaborate and study together more effectively. We wanted to give students the ability to create their own study sessions and choose in-person locations to meet up with other students who share their academic goals.

## What it does

DubMeets is a web platform that allows students to create and join study sessions based on their classes. Students can collaborate with other students who share their academic interests and choose in-person locations to meet up for their study sessions. Students can show their interests by hitting attend on these meetings.

## How we built it

We built DubMeets in two parts the frontend and the backend. The Frontend used Typscript and React to help build a responsive UI. The backend used Typescript, Node, AWS, Amplify, and Google maps API to help build an effefctive data storage platform. Putting both together we were able to create a responsive and scalable platform.

## Challenges we ran into

We faced a few challenges during the development of DubMeets, such as integrating Google maps location features, working with AWS and S3 to get our backend working perfectly, and working with the time constraint to get a project finished. However, we were able to overcome these challenges by working collaboratively and leveraging our resources.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of being able to create a working full stack application within the limits of the hackathon using AWS and the Google maps API to display location and setup meeting locations. We are proud of getting S3 buckets working to be able to store images for meetings.

## What we learned

Through the development of DubMeets, we learned the importance of collaboration, user feedback, and iteration. We also gained valuable experience in web development, database management, cloud development, and user experience design.

## What's next for DubMeets

Our next steps for DubMeets include expanding the platform to more campuses and universities, integrating more features based on user feedback, and partnering with academic institutions to provide additional support and resources for students. We're excited to continue improving and growing DubMeets to help students achieve academic success.
